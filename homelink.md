## 1 Road User Behavior Observation

### a. What are the sequence of traffic light durations?

For one side of a four way intersection, the sequence of traffic
lights are the following: 1) left turn green (about 10s), 2) left turn
yellow (1~2s), 3) four way red (3~4s), 4) straight green (about 15s), 
5) straight yellow (1~2s), 6) red (about 30s).

### b. What is the duration of the four way red before the green light?

The four way red is about 3s to 4s.

### c. What is the purpose of this sequencing?

The left turn green goes first to ensure the left turn traffic do not
block the opposite straight traffic. The left turn yellow provides
warning of the left turn red light. The four way red light ensures
that the intersection is clear before the green light for the straight
traffic. The straight green is longer than the left trun greens since
there are more straight traffic. 

### d. Similarly what are the sequences of the left turn arrow lights? 

For one way, the left arrow light follows this order: 1) green for
about 10s, 2) yellow for 1s to 2s, 3) red for about 60s. 

### e. Are there amber left turn arrow lights?

Yes

### f. How many drivers run yellow lights?

It is very common, 9 drivers run the yellow light in the 10 minutes
observation. 

### g. How many drivers run red lights?

It is rare, I did not observe any driver runs the red lights.

### h. How many drivers make improper right turns on a protected left turn? 

This is not very common, 2 improper right turns in the 10 minutes
observation.

### i. Armed with the knowledge of your observation, how would you deal with this intersection while executing a left turn?

I will follow the following three principles: 1) when the left turn
arrow light is green, go through the intersection quickly; 2) when
the arrow light turns yellow and if I am safe to stop, I will stop,
otherwise finish the left turn quickly; 3) always watch for the
improper right turns at the finishing stage of the left turn.

### j. What types of pedestrian lights are used at the intersection Pictograph walking man or hand in stop position? Countdown crossing timer?
	
It is the pictograph walking man for about 5 seconds and then becomes
a timer for 15 seconds.

### k. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each type?

The pictograph walking man is easy to understand especially for the
kids, but the pedestrians cannot see how many seconds left for them to
cross. The hand light provide warnings for the pedestrians to move
quickly and cautiously, but it does not provide the information of the
time as well. The timer light informs the pedestrians the time left
but as straightforward as the pictograph walking man. 

### l. Do you know what is scrambled intersection? Would this intersection benefit from one?
	
This intersection is much safer for the pedestrians especially in the
school zone. 

### m. How many pedestrians disobey the traffic?

Many pedestrians disobey the traffic, at my observation, 13
pedestrians come by and 5 of them run for the red light.

### n. Armed with the knowledge of your observation how would you deal with errant pedestrians?
	
I will not expect the pedestrians obey the traffic lights and always
prepare for the errant ones. So I will slow down when I see
pedestrians about to come even it is a red light for them. 

### o. What are these signs? List them all.

In the intersection I observed, there are four type of signs: 1) yield
sign, 2) keep to the right of the traffic island, 3) hazard close to
the edge of the road, 4) information sign for the 417 highway
entrance.

### p. Are they easy or difficult to recognize? Is the intersection "sign busy" making the observation distracting?

They are easy to recognize. Since there are only four type of signs,
it is neither "sign busy" nor distracting.

### q. How would you deal with the information presented to you?

If I am sure about which way I should go, I will ignore the
information sign otherwise pay attention to it. I will pay most
attention to the regulation signs such as the stop sign and the yield
sign. It is easy to infer the information provided by the warning
signs such as the traffic island sign and hazard sign by the sight of
the road at day time. Therefore these warning signs are not as
important at day time as at night. 

### r. Are the buildings and businesses on the four corners distracting?

They are not very distracting at the intersection I observed since the
buildings are not high and keep a good distance from the road. 

## 2 Vehicle Behavior Observation

### 1.a What just happened?

The car starts and moves straight forward in constant speed. 

### 1.b Where is the vehicle going?

It goes straight forward.

### 1.c Why is the vehicle going straight?

It is because the wheels are straight and the ground is flat. There is no force to push the car out of 
the straight line.

### 2.a What just happened?

The car turns to the left.

### 2.b Where the vehicle going?

The car goes to the left.

### 2.c Why the vehicle turning?

It is because the font wheels turns to the left and guide the car to the left.

### 3.a What just happened?

The car stops turning left and goes straight forward.

### 3.b Where is the vehicle going?

The car goes straight forward.

### 3.c Why is the vehicle going straight?

Because the font wheels return to the straight position after the hands left the steering wheel.

### 4.a What just happened?

The tail of the car turns to the left.

### 4.b Where is the vehicle going?

It goes to the back and left.

### 4.c Why is the vehicle turning?

It is because the font wheels turns to the left and they rotate backward. So they guide the car 
turning to the left.

### 5.a What just happened?

The car still turning left.

### 5.b Where is the vehicle going?

It still goes back left.

### 5.c Why is the vehicle still turning left?
